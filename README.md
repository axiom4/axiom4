My name is Riccardo, and I work in the IT field, where I have gained extensive experience in both technical and management roles. I specialize in designing and implementing IT infrastructures, working on both cloud and on-premise environments to deliver scalable and resilient solutions. I also focus on software integration, ensuring seamless communication between different systems to create efficient and well-coordinated environments.

Throughout my career, I have held roles such as project manager and account manager, overseeing complex projects that required balancing resources, timelines, and budgets. I particularly enjoy team management, as I believe that the success of a project comes from harmony and collaboration within the group.

Another area of interest is cybersecurity: I work to ensure that infrastructures are secure and compliant with regulations, adopting best practices and addressing compliance challenges in an ever-evolving technological landscape.

Outside of work, I am passionate about wild life photography, striving to capture the beauty and essence of nature. Additionally, I enjoy tackling CTF (Capture The Flag) challenges, combining my passion for cybersecurity with the thrill of solving complex and stimulating problems.
